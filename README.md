This is my personal config, it reads from a json file to enable some modules
that I wrote and it covers all my basic needs.

## Config

Most of your configs should go under `./user`, and if you want to make use of
the modules that this config provides you could open `./user/settings.json` and
figure out what things are useful to you.
