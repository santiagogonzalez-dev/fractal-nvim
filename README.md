# Base install
If you are looking to get started or want to see how I set up my environment
you can find it [here](https://github.com/santigo-zero/csjarchlinux/blob/master/50-nvim.sh).
*note: delete the line 5 in this script since it's cloning my dotfiles using
ssh.* This script installs tools that you most likely want.
After installing everything enter into neovim and do `:PackerSync` and reload.
